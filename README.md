# Image-Processing-Showcase-Edge-Detection-and-Downsampling
  Explore the fascinating world of image processing with this Python script showcasing two essential techniques: edge detection and downsampling.Leveraging the power of SciPy and NumPy libraries, this code provides a hands-   on experience in transforming digital images.

# Key Features:
  Edge Detection:
    Uncover hidden details in images using a convolution operation with customizable filters.
    Experiment with different filter configurations to observe diverse edge detection effects.
        
  Downsampling:
    Condense image data by selecting the maximum pixel value in 2x2 neighborhoods.
    Witness a reduction in image resolution while retaining essential features.

# Usage:
  Clone the repository.
  Run the script to process a sample image or replace it with your custom images.
  Visualize the results with Matplotlib.
